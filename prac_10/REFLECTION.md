# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

it usually varied from practical to practical, some practicals were harder so it took longer while some were easier so i could hit or be earlier than the benchmark i set for myself

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimates actually got more and more deviated as i progressed in the course main due to how i had to balance out the increasing difficulty of the course with the increasing difficulty and time from other courses as well

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To set realistic standards for my estimates, and to plan checkpoints to meet these estimates

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

not much, the comments were mainly "good code" or "good", i took comments more from the lecturer

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Code reviews weren't sent to me

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

week 1-5 was good as there was a well rounded build up, week 6-10 the difficulty exponetially spiked, i feel that for week 6-10 there should be more coverage and teaching with maybe a adjustment to the difficulty then

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

From the progress from week 1 to 10, i have been improving on building up my ability to do display good code ethics (doc strings, naming of functions) and also in the aspect of self-learning
